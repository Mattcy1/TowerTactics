Prepare to push the limits of your defense skills with unprecedented challenges and advanced tactical management.\n\n" +
        "Fatigue Bar: Push Your Towers to the Limit\n" +
        "Every tower is now equipped with a fatigue bar that fills up over time as it relentlessly fires at the Bloons. The more your towers work, the more they wear out. If the fatigue bar reaches its maximum, your towers risk becoming less effective or even stopping temporarily. It is crucial to monitor this bar and adopt a rotation and rest strategy to keep your defense line operational.\n\n" +
        "Ammunition: Fuel Your Arsenal\n" +
        "Times have changed, and your towers now need ammunition to function. All towers use the same type of ammunition: Darts. Earn money by popping Bloons and use it to purchase ammo recharges. Smart budget and ammo management are essential to ensure you never run out of firepower.\n\n" +
        "Periodic Taxes: Keep Your Towers Operational\n" +
        "In addition to managing fatigue and ammunition, you'll need to pay taxes every 10 rounds to keep your towers operational. If you refuse to pay, all your towers will be sold. If you accept, your towers will remain, but your cash will be halved by 30%. This adds an extra layer of strategy, as you'll need to balance your spending on upgrades, ammunition, and periodic taxes to ensure your towers remain active.\n\n" +
        "User Interface (UI): Simplified Management\n" +
        "Our new user interface offers simplified and intuitive management of your towers. Easily track fatigue bars, ammo levels, and periodic payment timers for each tower. Use dedicated buttons to perform manual pauses and repairs in real-time.\n\n" +
        "Prepare for an Unmatched Gaming Experience\n" +
        "With the tower maintenance and fatigue system, every decision counts. Dive into a deeper and more strategic gameplay experience where smart resource management and anticipating your towers' needs can make the difference between victory and defeat. Adaptability, strategy, and mastery are the keys to triumphing over the waves of Bloons with these new mechanics.\n\n" +
